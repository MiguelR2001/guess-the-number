guess-the-number
In this application you'll use JS to pick a random number between 1 and 10.  Once the number is chosen, the user can guess a number and your application will provide feedback, 'higher', 'lower' or Got it! in which case the user wins!

Your application will also need to keep track of how many guesses it took and tell the user in the feedback.  The feedback could be for example:

Congratulations! You guessed the correct number, which was 7 and it took you 3 guesses.

Your code must deal properly with singular and plural.  For example, it took you only one guess.
